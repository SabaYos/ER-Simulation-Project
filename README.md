# ER Simulation Project 
This project simulates an Emergency Room workflow using Python, modeling patient arrivals, registration, and treatment with severity-based prioritization. It evaluates the impact of staffing levels on waiting times. 
 
## Files 
- `er_simulation_updated.py`: Main simulation code (versions with 2 doctors/1 nurse and 4 doctors/2 nurses). 
- `*.csv`: Output data files (patient timelines, treatment times). 
- `*.png`: Graphs (waiting times, queue sizes, treatment times). 
- `Emergency_Room_Simulation_Project_Report.pdf`: Detailed project report. 
 
## How to Run 
1. Install dependencies: `pip install pygame matplotlib numpy` 
2. Run the simulation: `python er_simulation_updated.py`
